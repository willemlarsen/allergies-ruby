# Allergies

Hi, I'm Willem Larsen. Allergies. It seems like everyone has them. Well this little piece of ruby code tries to make it a little more orderly. Different allergies are equal to a number, summed up into a total for an individual, and the total can then be analyzed for what they are allergic to.

This is inspired by the curriculum at learnhowtoprogram.com.
